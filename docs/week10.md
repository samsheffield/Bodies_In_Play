## 10/31: Kinetic Input Prototyping

### Today

- Check out your prototypes
- Prototyping Input
- Introduce Project 2

### Check out your cardboard prototypes
Demo your prototype for the class! How does it work? Can we try it out?

### Play JS Joust
Fingers crossed all the tech still works as expected!

### Workshop: Prototyping Kinetic Input

_(Graphic by Emily Mills)_


Work with a partner to prototype from the following digital actions using cardboard, conductive tape, and the Makey Makey:
- Push, Pull, Turn, Shake, Momentary Push* , Momentary Pull*


_*Most buttons are momentary because they have a spring which disconnects the conductive parts of the circuit. How can you create a spring-like effect?_

To-do:
- Work with a partner (or 2 if the numbers are weird)
- Pick 3 from the list. _Can't decide? I'll pick!_
- At least 1 needs to involve an action not done with your hand or finger.
- Create some sort of simple digital output to respond to your input– _Play a sound, move a shape, change a color, show some text, etc._
- Email me documentation of your prototypes– photo of each being used and short video clip.
- Groups will share around 1pm.
