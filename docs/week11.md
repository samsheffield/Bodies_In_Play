### Homework

#### Work on your CONTROL[LER] prototype
Complete development of your prototype. Playtesting next week begins @ 9:30. Be sure to bring cameras for documentation.

#### Game Design needs your help!
We're still looking for one or two additional students to help showcase games at the MD STEM Festival this Saturday (11/12) and the MD Science Center Invent the Future event on 11/19. These are great opportunities to show off your work, talk with kids interested in game design, meet some local game developers, and do a little CV boosting! 

Interested in participating in either event? Please contact Sam as soon as possible for more information.

_P.S. The prototypes you're doing now would be perfect for the MD Science Center event!_
