## 11/21: Playing with/for others. Circuits workshop

### Finish up project 2 playtesting
- We have two more projects to review
- Make sure to document your games while they are being played!

### Circuits workshop
Some fun components to experiment with today. These are all digital inputs (buttons and switches) so to connect to the Makey Makey, just add one wire to each conductive leg of the component* 

*_More than one leg?_ Use a multimeter to figure out the pair you want! More below...

#### Components:
Arcade buttons
- Two big legs to solder wires to. Momentary action. Can take high impact from hands and fingers. Two standard hole sizes: 30mm and 24mm. Two mounting styles: snap-in and screw on.

Latching buttons
- These are from flashlights! Toggle action- click on, click off. These are good for finger presses, but can be hidden under a bigger surface too. Mounting style: strong glue

Microswitch
- These are great to hide under/inside something. Available in many sizes. Momentary action. Mounting style: little screws (#6 or smaller)These are often used in arcade games to indicate that a coin has been inserted! When wiring you may need to use a multimeter to find which pair of legs you want to solder wires to.

Toggle switches
- There are many kinds of these with 2-3 positions (poles). When wiring you may need to use a multimeter to find which pair you want to solder wires to. Mounting style: Panel mount using a nut. Hole size is often 1/4" or 3/16".

Shake & tilt switches
- These are literally a little metal ball inside a can. On one side, this metal ball connects a circuit. Button press! These can be used as crude tilt detectors, shake sensors, strike sensors. Some care needs to be taken to make sure the legs do not touch (electrical tape is a good option). Mounting style: Tape or strong glue.

Reed switches
- These switches close when a strong magnet is present. Has to be a _strong_ magnet. Cheap magnets won't really work. Use a _really_ strong magnet and you can hide this switch under/inside something and pass a magnet embedded insomething else over it. Keep the magnet away from the Makey Makey though! Mounting style: tape or glue


### Using a multimeter
A multimeter is a tool which is used to inspect the different characteristics of an elctronic circuit. For us, it's most useful to check continuity between two points in our circuits. Great for when something stops working and you want to identify where the problem might lie.

Continuity mode is usually indicated with a symbol that either looks like a musical note or a sound wave.

To use, put the multimeter into continuity mode and then touch one point of the circuit with one lead, and then another point with the other lead. _Did it beep?_ The circuit is good between those two points!

### Project 3: Playable Bodies Soon
Next week, we'll start the final prototype for this class. [Here's the description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iL_bHYqqaTTQPt5AmAQFBnyGwph5poz6aiKRbq9krrI/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to start thinking about it and identifying people to work with!

## Homework

### Have a nice break
- No homework this week. Enjoy the long weekend!

### Documentation?
- Did you finish it? Did you email me the link?

## Next weeks
- 11/28 - Soft circuits workshop. Project work session
- 12/05 - Class visit from Michelle Pineda of Dolphin Dungeon to playtest Cosmic Crash! Project work session.
- 12/12 - Project playtesting & documentation. Last class!
