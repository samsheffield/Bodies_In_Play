## 11/28: Soft Circuits workshop. Project work session

### Soft circuits workshop
Some fun materials to experiment with today! Let's experiment with making and testing soft switches made (mostly) with fabrics.

#### Important things to know:
- Soft circuits will never be as reliable as manufactured components
- The basic principle: two conductive* materials separated by a perforated, spongy, non-conductive material like felt, cardboard, or foam. 
- Thicker spongy materials need a larger perforation (Be sure to test!)
- Conductive textiles are expensive and fragile. Think of them as interfaces to standard wiring. [There are inexpensive ways around this](http://www.instructables.com/id/Soft-button/)!

_* Conductive materials are materials which can easily conduct electricity. Metals, for example._

#### Key materials
- Conductive fabric & thread (used for contact and connecting to wires/hardware)
- Aluminum foil & duct tape (cheap alternative to conductive fabric). Avoid non-stick foil!
- Felt, uphostery foam, or any flexible foam stabilizer (basically any squishy non-conductive material for your button's core)
- Needle and non-conductive thread and/or fabric glue
- _Optional: Heat fusible interface and an iron (used to stick fabric together). Do not use a steam setting!_

#### Show me your button
Work alone or partner with someone to create a small soft switch that can trigger the Makey Makey. When you finish, show me your working circuit.

### Project 3: Playable Bodies
Here is the project description for the final prototype in this class. [Here's the description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iL_bHYqqaTTQPt5AmAQFBnyGwph5poz6aiKRbq9krrI/edit?usp=sharing).

_It is highly, highly recommended that you collaborate on this with at least one other person._

### Work session
Focus on doing the groundwork for your project for the remainder of class

- Decide if you want to work solo or not. You can work with as many people as you'd like. Let me know who you are working with.
- Start bulding!
- _No leaving class early, even if you make a plan to meet up with your teammates later in the week._ Use this time to get work done and meet with me to discuss plans before the end of class.

## Homework

### Work on Playable Bodies prototype
Each team should have progress made by the beginning of class next week. Be ready to quickly share it with the group near the start of class.

## Next weeks
- 12/05 - Class visit from Michelle Pineda of Dolphin Dungeon to playtest Cosmic Crash! Project work session and check-in.
- 12/12 - Project playtesting & documentation. Last class!
- 12/16 - All documentation and missing classwork is due.
