## 12/12: Final project playtesting

### This week
- 12/12 - Project playtesting & documentation. Last class!
- 12/16 - __All documentation and missing classwork is due. Fill out course evaluations. Return Makey Makeys + USB cables to the grey cabinet__


### Playtesting session
- Have games ready to play by 9:30 a.m.
- Make sure to document your games while they are being played!

### Produce Documentation (Due by the end of the week)
The goal is to produce documentation which is descriptive (what is interesting/fun about your game), shows how it's played, and also captures the tone/feeling of your game (is it playful? serious? silly?)

#### Work on a team?
If you worked on a team, you only need to create one set of video documentation, still images, and rules. However, each team member must provide their own written statement and include it in the documentation folder.


### Documentation Requirements
Email me a link to an online folder with the following by the end of the week:

#### Video documentation
Format: Exported MP4 video clip (not project file) 

- No longer than 5 minutes
- Should demonstrate your game being played 
- Include screen recordings (use OBS or similar, do not point a camera at your computer screen!)
- The style should match the tone/feeling of your game
- Include the title of the game & who made it
- *Optional: upload to YouTube in addition to providing video file*

#### Still images

Format: jpegs which are no larger than 1920 x 1080px

Include:
- 4 images of your game being played
- 2 screenshots of the digital game
- 1-2 images of the controller(s) against a neutral, non-distracting background or being worn by a player


#### Short written statement

Format: txt file, pdf, or Google Doc

Describe:
- Your game (What is it? What do you play it with? What inspired it?)
- What was the player experience you were designing? (Were you successful, or not? Why?)
- At least one challenge you experienced, or thing you learned, in the process of making it.
- At least one thing that you like, or find successful, about your prototype.
