Project description is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xBRKKRS70iWD_j_rpygbdHEs1WU__wc6tqvp11poOvo/edit?usp=sharing).

### Work session
Focus on doing the groundwork for your sport for the remainder of class

- Decide if you want to work solo or not. You can work with as many people as you'd like. (I'll encourage you to work with at least one other person, but this isn't mandatory) I will not place you in a group.
- Experiment with things from the Regulation Sports Equipment which I've provided to build your sport around. *Duplicate equipment? Sounds like an opportunity to collaborate...*

### Homework

#### Work on your new sport prototype
Begin developing your new sport. Prototypes will need to be playable by 11am next week. Bring painter's tape if you want to mark off a playing field on the floor.

#### Studio217 Playtesting Visit
Local indie game studio Studio217 will be on-campus to playtest their newest VR game, Pin City in two weeks on Saturday, Oct 8th, from 11-3pm. Please stop by to test their game and chat with the developers.
