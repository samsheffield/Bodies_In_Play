## 10/03: Hi!

### Today

- Project check-ins and playtesting


### Project 1: New Sport!
Project description is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xBRKKRS70iWD_j_rpygbdHEs1WU__wc6tqvp11poOvo/edit?usp=sharing).

### Playtesting
Playtesting will begin at 11am. Everything must be ready to play by then.

*Why playtest?* We playtest to check assumptions and see if things work as expected or not. It can be stressful to watch people fumble through your game, but also *very informative*. Try your best to not interrupt, take notes, and follow-up with questions!


### Homework

#### Complete your new sport prototype
Wrap up development of your new sport. Prototypes will need to be playable by 10am next week. Make sure to bring everything you need, including something to document your work!

#### Want to playtest your game more tonight?
If you want to playtest your game some more, stop by the Game Lab between 6-8 tonight. Melanie is organizing a low-key game night/playtesting session.

#### Studio217 Playtesting Visit on Saturday
This Saturday, local game developers and MICA alumni, Studio217, will be visiting the MICA Game Lab to playtest Pin City, a fun VR bowling game with the spirit of mini-golf!

This is an opportunity for students to chat with the developers, give them some much appreciated feedback, and ask your burning game dev questions… *How do you make a VR game? How do you start a small indie studio? How do you participate in festivals such as Pax East and MagFest? How do you make money? What is life… post-MICA????*

Time & place: This Saturday (10/08), 11-3pm. Room D220 (Game Lab)

Open to all MICA students. Bring your friends!
