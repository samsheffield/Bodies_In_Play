## 10/10: Project 1 Playtesting

### Today

- Project playtesting & documentation session
- Upcoming Fall Break (no class next week)

### Playtesting session
- Have games ready to play by 10 a.m.
- Approximately 25 minutes per game.
- Make sure to document your games while they are being played!

### Homework

#### Produce Documentation (Due start of class 10/24)
The goal is to produce documentation which is descriptive (what is interesting/fun about your game), shows how it's played, and also captures the tone/feeling of your game (is it playful? serious? silly?).

##### Work on a team?
If you worked on a team, you only need to create one set of video documentation, still images, and rules. However, each team member must provide their own written statement and include it in the documentation folder.

*Do not work on this over Fall Break. Please take a break.*


#### Deliverables:

By the start of class on 10/24, email me a link to an online folder with the following:

##### Video documentation

Format: Exported MP4 video clip (not project file) 

- No longer than 5 minutes
- Should demonstrate your game being played 
- The style should match the tone/feeling of your game
- Include the title of the game & who made it
- *Optional: upload to YouTube in addition to providing video file*

##### Still images

Format: jpegs which are no larger than 1920 x 1080px

Include:
- 4 images of your game being played
- 1-2 images of its components against a neutral, non-distraccting background

##### Rulesheet

Format: pdf, txt file, or Google Doc. _No Word files._

Written rules:
- Logically structured, including all necessary information to play the game 
- Use images to help communicated complex ideas.
- This can be approached in the spirit of your game. For example, if your game intentionally complicates the rules
- Have someone else check for typos and spelling/grammar mistakes

##### Short written statement

Format: txt file, pdf, or Google Doc

Describe:
- Your sport (What is it?What do you play it with? What inspired it?)
- What was the player experience you were designing? (Were you successful, or not? Why?)
- At least one challenge you experienced, or thing you learned, in the process of making it.
- At least one thing that you like, or find successful, about your sport prototype.
- At least one thing that you would improve or do differently.
- Include name of your sport prototype and the names of people who made it.
