### Workshop: How to make an interface out of (almost) anything!


#### Introduction to the Makey Makey

__Overview__

The Makey Makey is an easy to use keyboard emulator that allows you to turn almost anything into a button.

- No programming necessary!
- Digital (on/off) input signals act as keytrokes
- Classic Makey Makey can emulate 18 keys (6 front, 12 back)
    - Keys that are readily available with alligator clips: Up, down, left, right, Space, Mouse click
    - Additional keys using wires + alligator clips: WASDFG
- Hackable! It is possible to modify the firmware using Arduino software (for example to change keys)
- Price: $49.99 for the classic version (can easily find them used on eBay for half the price!)

#### Basic functionality

To create a keypress, you simply need to complete a circuit connecting one part of the Makey Makey to another:
- The positive side connected to one of the metallic input pads.
- The grounded side connected to the metallic strip along the bottom edge.

When these two areas are connected through something conductive, the corresponding key will be pressed. On the backside, small wires can be inserted into the black headers for the positive side of the circuit.

#### Cardboard Interface
Use cardboard, found metal objects, copper tape, aluminum foil, & Makey Makeys to hack together a custom controller prototype for a simple digital game of your choice. _It's highly recommended you work with a partner or two._ 

You have some options for games:
- You can make the digital game (keep it simple!)
- Use a game (or other playful interactive digital thing) you've already made
- Use a simple digital game that you did not make

##### Materials:

- Borrow a Makey Makey (or two, as long as each group has at least one)
- Paper tape and copper tape are in the grey cabinet. There are other things in the cabinet. Dig around.
- There is cardboard in the D230 classroom closet that you can use. Be mindful that this is a shared resource and source your own cardboard if you want to go big!
- There are a lot of metal things in this world that can provide interesting concepts for controllers. There are even non-metallic things which will work! Experiment.
- Make alligator cables as you need them. The supplies are in the grey cabinet and soldering irons are on the workbench outside the Game Lab.

##### Additional guidance:

- Focus on experimenting and understanding the materials & tools
- Explore meaningful (fun, weird, challenging, interesting) relationships between the physical interaction and the action onscreen
- It's okay if the interface looks rough, or is fragile. _It's a prototype!_
- Think 3-dimensionally (cardboard has many affordances as a building material)
- Cut & score cardboard on tables in the Main Lab, not the classroom. Use cutting mats. Use caution.

#### How to safely cut cardboard
- You can safely cut thin sheets of cardboard with sharp scissors
- You can cut straight lines using utility or exacto knives and a metal ruler. 
- Make sure the blade is sharp and cut the cardboard using several passes.
- Apply firm pressure to both the hand holding the ruler and the knife.
- Scoring the cardboard is a great way to make bends.

### Soldering demo
Soldering well is a skill and you will get better at it the more you do it. Don't stress out too much if it seems hard now. 

Some things to know:

- Soldering temperature is typically around 650 degrees F. That can easily burn you or start a fire.
- Never leave a soldering iron on while unattended (our soldering stations only take about 10 seconds to reach temperature)
- Never hold the thing you're soldering in your hands! Use helping hands to hold wire and electronic components (they're going to get hot faster than you think!)
- Most soldering jobs will only take a few seconds of contact. An exception is soldering to a large metal surface. Check iron temperature if it's taking longer.
- Do not use soldering irons to burn or melt things. We have a heat gun for that kind of work
- Do not eat or drink while soldering. Be sure to wash your hands to minimize possible lead exposure
- Use a fume extractor when soldering. Goggles are probably a good idea too.
- Keep the soldering iron tip clean by dragging it against a _damp_ sponge between soldering attempts.
- Not all metals are solderable. (You can't solder aluminum with our tools)


#### Soldering practice!
Use the wire and alligator clips provided in class to make connectors for the Makey Makey:
- 1-2 feet of wire (this wire has two strands)
    - Separate the strands as you need
    - Trim off about 1/4 inch of insulation from the end of each strand
- 4 mini alligator clips (one for each end of the strands)
    - Pass the conductive strand through the small hole in the base to solder


### Homework

#### Complete your cardboard interface
Have this ready to demonstrate next week at the start of class:

- It can look rough. That's okay. Focus on the connection between the physical interaction & the game.
- Don't forget to take a Makey Makey with you.
- Have a copy of your game installed on your own computer.
- Email me a photo of your controller, a screenshot of your digital game, and a brief video clip of being played as documentation.
